        <p>
          It is really important to educate yourself before making your diamond purchase. Learn about the 4C's (cut, colour, clarity, and carat) and how they affect the lustre, sparkle, quality, and price of a diamond.</p>

        <h3>Carat</h3>
        <div class="text">
          <p>People usually get confused between Carat and Size. Carat refers to the weight of a diamond, while the size refers to the measurement of the stone in millimetres.</p>
          <p>If you have a 1ct diamond that is cut very deep, the size of the diamond may look like an 0.80ct stone, while it can still weigh 1ct. If you have a Ict diamond that is cut very shallow, the size of the diamond may look like a 1.25ct stone, while potentially weighing 1ct due to its shallowness. A well-cut diamond will look like a lct and also weigh Ict.</p>
          <p>When diamonds are cut too shallow or too deep, the diamond will not look brilliant and in some cases appear dark or empty in the centre.</p>

      <div class="clarity">
        <div class="heading">
          <h3>Clarity</h3>
          <div class="text">
            <p class="mt-5">The clarity of a diamond is based on how many or how few
              imperfections (known as inclusions) there are in the stone as well as where these inclusions occur. <br>
              According to GIA, diamond clarity is labelled by the following chart:</p>
            <p>
              <span>Flawless (FL), Internally Flawless (IF)</span> <br>
  Flawless (FL) and Internally Flawless (IF) diamonds have no visible inclusions inside the stone when looking at the stone through a 10x magnification. IF diamonds may have some surface marks (blemishes) under 10x magnification.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Very Very Slight Inclusions (VVSI & VVS2)</span> <br>
  VVSI and VVS2 clarity diamonds have very tiny inclusions that are extremely difficult to see under 10x magnification, even to
  gemmologists and diamond experts. Some inclusions that may be in a VVS diamond could be pinpoints, needles, or internal graining.
            </p>
            <p>
             <span>Very Slight Inclusions (VSI & VS2)</span> <br>
  VSI and VS2 clarity diamonds have slightly larger inclusions than the VVS range. These are difficult (VSI) to somewhat easy (VS2) to see under 10x magnification. Some inclusions that might be in VS diamonds are crystals, cavities, or clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Slight Inclusions (SII & SI2)</span> <br>
  SII and S12 clarity diamonds have larger inclusions than the VS range. To the trained eye, these inclusions are easily visible under 10x
  magnification. Some inclusions that might be on an Sl diamond are chips, knots, and feathers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Included (11, 12 & 13)</span> <br>
  11-13 clarity diamonds have much more pronounced inclusions. These inclusions are easily seen with the naked eye. These large inclusions may also affect the brilliance of the diamond.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Novita's Recommendation:</span> <br>
  At Novita Diamonds, we believe that you should get the nicest looking diamond for your budget. Therefore we recommend IF, VVSI, VVS2, VSI, VS2 and Sil as they all have inclusions not visible to the naked eye.

        <h3>Colour</h3>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Diamond Colour refers to how colourless the stone is. The clearer (white) the stone is, the more valuable it becomes. As we move down the scale, the diamonds start to have more colour in them such as slight tints of yellow or brown, which decreases the value of the diamond. The GIA diamond chart grades diamonds from D (colourless) to Z (light yellow or brown). GIA groups diamonds into several categories.

        <div class="text">
          <p>
            D,E,F (colourless) <br>
D-F grade diamonds are grouped as colourless. This is the rarest and highest grade of diamonds available. When these diamonds are in a setting, they will all look the same to an untrained eye. To tell the difference, these stones must be loose and compared to each other on a white background. They are extremely clear and bright and have no yellow tints.
          </p>
          <p>
            G,H (near colourless) <br>
G-H grade diamonds are grouped as near colourless. They have a very faint tint of colour which is not very noticeable to the naked eye. When in a setting, they will appear more or less white, however when loose and compared to colourless diamonds, a very slight tint in the stones will be noticeable.
          </p>
          <p>
            IJ (very faint colour) <br>
- grade diamonds are grouped as very faint colour. These diamonds have a slightly noticeable yellow, brown or grey tint when compared to diamonds in the colourless category. Anything lower than a J colour will have more noticeable yellow, brown or grey tint in the stone.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the untrained eye, diamonds with a 1 or 2 colour difference may look very similar.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Novita's opinion:</span> As D-F colour diamonds look very similar to the untrained eye, there usually isn't a great need to get a D coloured diamond over an E or F. We believe it's more important to look at the cut and shape.
          </p>
          <p>
            G-H colour diamonds have are near colourless and are a good "budget stone". With these colours you can get a much larger stone for a similar price to a smaller D-F coloured diamond. <br>
<span>Novita's Recommendation:</span> Novita's Recommendation: We recommend looking at stones that are D-G in colour.
